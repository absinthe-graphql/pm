# Absinthe Project Management

This project contains meeting notes, agenda items, and other project/release
management artifacts that don't fit easily into PRs or Issues.

## Meetings

#### Core Team

The core team plans to meet at least once a month to discuss project direction, collaboratively triage issues and PRs,
and plan releases.
